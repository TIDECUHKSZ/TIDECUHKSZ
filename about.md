With the widespread adoption of digital technologies (robotics, machine learning and AI, sensors, virtual reality and so on) in economic activities (production, distribution, trade), the global economy is undergoing a digital transformation. The resulting and rapidly evolving digital economy is continuously replacing and expanding the traditional economy. To meet the technology needs of the growing digital economy, SDS create the Technology and Innovation Center for Digital Economy (数字经济技术创新中心) on March 7th, 2023 to promote research and education collaborations between faculty members in this area, engage interested students, and help build connections with industry and academic partners.

# The Objectives of This Center
<!-- list -->
1. Encourage the collaboration between faculty members in SDS and in CUHKSZ;
2. Increase the visibility of the research of SDS faculty members;
3. Host undergraduate capstone projects;
4. Co-advise graduate students;
5. Build connection of faculty with industry and academic partners.

# Organization of the Center
The center has a steering committee (including a director and an executive director) responsible for its operation. Within the center, there are several (currently five) interest groups. Each interest group focuses on one research area of common interest to group members. Any regular member of the center needs to actively participate in at least one interest group.

**Rules for interest groups:**
1. Each group has at least two faculty members and one of them serves as the coordinator.
2. Each group needs to have regular planned activities (group meetings, seminars, etc.), and the schedule for these activities should be posted on the center website so that other faculty and students in SDS may also attend events without joining the interest group.
3. A member of an interest group should regularly attend group activities.
4. Interest group members can terminate an interest group if all members agree.
5. Any faculty member in SDS can create a new interest group after becoming a center member.
6. To establish stable collaboration, frequently changing group membership is strongly discouraged.
